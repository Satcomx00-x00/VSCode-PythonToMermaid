To create a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension, you will need to use the Visual Studio Code Extension API and the markdown-it library for parsing markdown and rendering it in the VSCode page. Here is an example of how you could create a VSCode extension that shows the structure of your code with function calls using markdown-it and mermaid:

Create a new VSCode extension by running the following command:
Copy code
```
$ yo code
```
This will prompt you to enter some information about your extension, such as its name and description.

Install the markdown-it and mermaid libraries as dependencies for your extension by running the following command:
Copy code

```
$ npm install markdown-it mermaid --save
```

In your extension's `package.json` file, add the following entry to the contributes section:
Copy code
```json
"contributes": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "showCodeStructure",
      "title": "Show Code Structure"
    }
  ]
}
```
This will add a new command to VSCode called "Show Code Structure" that we will use to display the code structure in a VSCode page.

In your extension's `index.js` file, add the following code to register a command handler for the "Show Code Structure" command:
Copy code
```js
module.exports = function(context) {
  // Import the markdown-it and mermaid libraries
  const md = require('markdown-it')();
  const mermaid = require('mermaid').mermaidAPI;

  // Register a command handler for the "Show Code Structure" command
  context.subscriptions.push(
    vscode.commands.registerCommand('showCodeStructure', () => {
      // Generate the code structure diagram using markdown and mermaid
      const markdown = generateCodeStructureDiagram();
      const html = md.render(markdown);

      // Show the code structure diagram in a new VSCode page
      vscode.workspace.openTextDocument({ content: html }).then(doc => {
        vscode.window.showTextDocument(doc);
      });
    })
  );
};
```
Add a function called ```generateCodeStructureDiagram()``` that generates the markdown for the code structure diagram using mermaid. Here is an example of how this function could work:
Copy code
```js
function generateCodeStructureDiagram() {
  // Scan the code to find all functions and their calls
  const functions = scanCodeForFunctions();

  // Generate the mermaid diagram code
  let markdown = '```mermaid\ngraph TD\n';
  for (const func of functions) {
    markdown += `  ${func.name} --> ${func.calls.join(' ')}\n`;
  }
  markdown += '```';

  return markdown;
}
```
Add a function called ```scanCodeForFunctions()``` that scans the code for all functions and their calls. This function will need to parse the code and extract the function names and their calls. Here is an example of how this function could work:

To continue coding the VSCode extension, you will need to implement the scanCodeForFunctions() function. This function will need to parse the code and extract the function names and their calls. Here is an example of how this function could work:

Copy code
```js
function scanCodeForFunctions() {
  // Get the current text editor
  const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
  if (!editor) return [];

  // Get the text of the current file
  const text = editor.document.getText();

  // Use a regular expression to find all function declarations
  const regex = /function\s+(\w+)\s*\(.*\)\s*\{/g;
  const functions = [];
  let match;
  while ((match = regex.exec(text))) {
    functions.push({
      name: match[1],
      calls: []
    });
  }

  // Use a regular expression to find all function calls
  regex = /(\w+)\s*\(/g;
  while ((match = regex.exec(text))) {
    // Check if the function call is a known function
    const func = functions.find(f => f.name === match[1]);
    if (func) {
      // Add the function call to the known function's list of calls
      func.calls.push(match[1]);
    }
  }

  return functions;
}
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all function declarations and calls in the code, and then it builds an array of objects representing the functions and their calls. You can then use this array to generate the markdown for the code structure diagram using mermaid.

To continue coding the VSCode extension, you will need to implement the ```generateCodeStructureDiagram()``` function. This function will generate the markdown for the code structure diagram using the output of the scanCodeForFunctions() function and the mermaid library. Here is an example of how this function could work:

Copy code
```js
function generateCodeStructureDiagram() {
  // Scan the code to find all functions and their calls
  const functions = scanCodeForFunctions();

  // Generate the mermaid diagram code
  let markdown = '```mermaid\ngraph TD\n';
  for (const func of functions) {
    markdown += `  ${func.name} --> ${func.calls.join(' ')}\n`;
  }
  markdown += '```';

  return markdown;
}
```
This function generates the markdown for the code structure diagram by iterating over the array of functions and their calls and adding a mermaid diagram code block to the markdown. The mermaid code block specifies the functions and their calls using the ```graph TD``` syntax, which tells mermaid to generate a directed graph with nodes representing the functions and edges representing the function calls.

Once you have implemented the ```generateCodeStructureDiagram()``` function, you can test your VSCode extension by opening a code file in VSCode, running the "Show Code Structure" command, and verifying that the code structure diagram is shown in a new VSCode page.
